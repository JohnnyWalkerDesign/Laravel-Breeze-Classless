# Laravel without TailWind

These are the default Laravel views (using a Laravel Breeze installation) with all TailWind styles removed. All styling and superfluous HTML has been removed. Everything is ready for you to start stying.

## Installation

Simply overwrite your views/ folder with these files.

Note: Don't forget to remove TailWind from your CSS. (You will most likely want to replace `.postCSS()` in your webpack.mix.js file with `.sass()`.)
